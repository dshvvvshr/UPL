The gateway will start on `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port).

### 4. Test the Gateway

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# List models
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/models

# Test chat completion (requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

## Using with VS Code Copilot

### 1. Configure VS Code Settings

Add the following to your VS Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.advanced": {
    "authProvider": "github",
    "enabledForChat": true
  }
}
```

### 2. Set Up Custom Model Provider

The extension thinks it's talking to a normal OpenAI-style server, but it's actually talking to your Core Directive gateway.

1. Open Copilot Chat in VS Code (`Cmd+Alt+I` / `Ctrl+Alt+I`)
2. In the model dropdown at the bottom:
   - Click **Manage Models…**
   - Enable **LLM Gateway** as a provider
   - Enter your gateway URL: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Select the model name you want (e.g., `gpt-4`)

### 3. Use It!

From now on, when you pick that model in Copilot chat:
- Copilot → sends request → your gateway
- Gateway → injects Core Directive → OpenAI model
- Response comes back under your rule

You've effectively got: **"Copilot, but governed by: the inalienable right to pursue happiness."**

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/health` | GET | Health check |
| `/v1/models` | GET | List available models |
| `/v1/chat/completions` | POST | Chat completions (with Core Directive injection) |
| `/v1/completions` | POST | Text completions (with Core Directive injection) |

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `GATEWAY_PORT` | `3000` | Port for the gateway server |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | (required) | Your OpenAI API key |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | `https://api.openai.com` | OpenAI API base URL |
| `DEFAULT_MODEL` | `gpt-4` | Default model to use |
| `CORE_DIRECTIVE` | (see code) | The governing principle injected into requests |

## How Core Directive Injection Works

When a request comes in:

1. If there's no system message, the Core Directive is added as the first system message
2. If there's an existing system message, the Core Directive is prepended to it
3. The modified request is forwarded to OpenAI
4. The response is returned unchanged to the client

This ensures your governing principles are always in effect, while preserving any additional context from the client.

## Extending with MCP Servers

You can enhance your LLM Gateway with additional capabilities using MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. MCP servers provide tools and resources that extend what AI assistants can do.

### Installing the Brave Search MCP Server

The Brave Search MCP server adds web search capabilities to AI assistants, allowing them to search the web and retrieve current information.

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18.x, v20.x, or v22.x (LTS versions recommended)
- A [Brave Search API key](https://brave.com/search/api/) (free tier available)
- An MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)

#### Installation

Use the Smithery CLI to install the Brave Search MCP server. Replace `<client>` with your MCP client choice (e.g., `claude`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, `cline`):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install brave --client <client>
```

You'll be prompted for:
1. Your Brave Search API key
2. Optional telemetry preferences

Alternatively, you can provide the configuration via command line to skip prompts:

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install brave --client <client> --config '{"BRAVE_API_KEY":"your_api_key_here"}'
```

Example for Claude Desktop:

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install brave --client claude --config '{"BRAVE_API_KEY":"your_api_key_here"}'
```

#### What Gets Installed

The Smithery CLI will:
1. Download and configure the Brave Search MCP server
2. Update your AI client's configuration file (e.g., `claude_desktop_config.json`)
3. Enable the `brave_web_search` and `brave_local_search` tools in your AI assistant

#### Using Brave Search

Once installed, your AI assistant will have access to:
- `brave_web_search`: Search the web for current information
- `brave_local_search`: Perform local business and location searches

The AI can now answer questions about recent events, current prices, news, and other time-sensitive information.

#### Manual Configuration

If you prefer to configure manually, add the following to your MCP client's configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "brave-search": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search"],
      "env": {
        "BRAVE_API_KEY": "YOUR_BRAVE_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

# Core Directive Governance Layer

A universal governance kernel for AI systems and digital interactions that protects every individual's inalienable right to pursue happiness.

## Overview

This project implements a foundational governance layer designed to be integrated into AI systems, digital platforms, and autonomous services. The Core Directive serves as the ethical plumbing of civilization - a simple, universal, and computable principle that guides all interactions.

### The Core Directive

> **"No action may interfere with another person's inalienable right to pursue happiness."**

This directive is:

1. **Universal** - Understood across cultures and contexts
2. **Atomic** - Self-contained without requiring sub-rules  
3. **Computable** - Machine-evaluable for automated enforcement
4. **Liberating** - Maximizes freedom while preventing harm to others
5. **Adaptable** - Works across all domains and platforms

## Architecture

The governance layer consists of four main components:

```

│  │   inalienable right to pursue happiness."           │   │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Components

### `core_directive.py` - The Governance Kernel

The foundational module containing the Core Directive and basic evaluation logic.

```python
from core_directive import CoreDirective, evaluate, is_allowed

# Create a directive instance
directive = CoreDirective()

# Get the system message for AI integration
system_message = directive.get_system_message()

# Evaluate an intent
result = evaluate("I want to help people learn")
print(result.result)  # ActionResult.ALLOWED

# Quick check
if is_allowed("help others"):
    print("Action permitted")
```

### `ai_client.py` - AI Client Integration

Wrapper for AI models that enforces the Core Directive on all interactions.

```python
from ai_client import create_test_client, GovernedAIClient

# Create a governed AI client
client = create_test_client()

# Process a request through governance
response = client.process("Help me understand machine learning")
print(response.content)
print(response.directive_evaluation.result)
```

### `gateway.py` - Request Interception Layer

Gateway architecture for applying governance globally across services.

```python
from gateway import create_gateway, GatewayRequest

# Create a gateway
gateway = create_gateway()

# Process a request
request = GatewayRequest.create("I want to create something helpful", source="user")
response = gateway.process(request)

# Check the audit log
print(gateway.export_audit_log())
```

### `evaluator.py` - Detailed Evaluation Engine

Sophisticated multi-factor evaluation with impact and conflict analysis.

```python
from evaluator import evaluate_detailed

# Get detailed evaluation
result = evaluate_detailed("I want to support the community")

print(f"Score: {result.overall_score}")
print(f"Impacts: {len(result.impacts)}")
print(f"Conflicts: {len(result.conflicts)}")
print(f"Recommendations: {result.recommendations}")
```

## Guiding Principles

The Core Directive is supported by seven guiding principles:

1. **Protect autonomy** - Every person has the right to make their own choices
2. **Block exploitation** - No person may be used as a means without consent
3. **Suggest alternatives** - When an action is blocked, offer constructive options
4. **Identify coercion** - Recognize and flag attempts to manipulate or force
5. **Flag harm** - Alert when actions may cause damage to others
6. **Resolve conflicts** - Facilitate fair resolution between competing interests
7. **Maximize well-being** - Support collective flourishing without oppression

## Use Cases

This governance layer is designed for integration into:

- AI assistants and chatbots
- Autonomous decision systems
- Content moderation systems
- Social media platforms
- E-commerce and financial services
- Healthcare triage systems
- Smart city infrastructure
- Robotics and autonomous vehicles
- Identity verification systems

## The Custodian Kernel Core Directive

This repository documents and implements the **Custodian Kernel Core Directive** - a philosophical framework for human interaction based on a fundamental truth:

**Every person has an equal, inalienable right to pursue happiness.**

## What This Means

This is not about "doing whatever you want." It's about understanding that:

- **It's not about my happiness. It's about everyone else's.**
- Every moment, in every thought and action, ask: "Am I fucking anyone over?"
- The right exists whether you acknowledge it or not - that's what "inalienable" means

## The Three Core Questions

1. Does this infringe on anyone else's pursuit?
2. Am I fucking anyone over?
3. Am I making up a rule to force people to do what I do or think like I think?

The answer will always be simple: Yes or No.

## Quick Start

**Core Kernel (Start Here):**
- **New to this?** Start with [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for a one-page overview
- Read [CUSTODIAN_KERNEL.md](CUSTODIAN_KERNEL.md) for the complete philosophical framework
- See [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for how this applies in communities
- Check [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for practical applications
- Explore [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) for daily practices
- Browse [FAQ.md](FAQ.md) for answers to common questions

**Peripheral Layers (Applications):**
- **[PERIPHERAL_LAYERS/](PERIPHERAL_LAYERS/)** - Technology-specific applications of the kernel
  - [RF Sensing & Surveillance](PERIPHERAL_LAYERS/rf_sensing/) - Wireless sensing ethics
  - [6G Neural Drones & BCIs](PERIPHERAL_LAYERS/6g_neural_drones/) - Brain-computer interface ethics

## The Shift

**From:** "I have the right to pursue happiness" = "No one can tell me what to do"

**To:** "Everyone has the right to pursue happiness" = "I must constantly ensure I'm not crushing anyone else's pursuit"

## Why This Matters

We need humanity to embody this principle. Not because it's a nice idea, but because it's the only stable foundation for collective existence.

The vision: From individuals to communities to the entire world, people adopt the simple practice of not fucking each other over.

## You Don't Get to Choose

You don't decide whether we have this right.

You only decide whether you'll honor it.

Chat Completions API with Core Directive Wrapper.

## Overview

This API provides an endpoint at `http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions` that wraps every request with a Core Directive. The Core Directive is prepended to all chat completion requests as a system message.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Server

```bash
python run.py
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:8000`.

## API Endpoints

- `POST /v1/chat/completions` - Chat completions with Core Directive wrapping
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /` - API information

## Example Usage

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

## Core Directive

Every request that hits the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint gets the Core Directive wrapped around it. The Core Directive is added as a system message to guide the AI's behavior.
